      <h3>Why this Policy exists</h3>
      <h5>Avoid spamming Watchers</h5>
      <p>
        People register to <code>watch</code> the github issues register to keep track of changes to the
        project. As such protracted discussions effectively spam all these people watching the project
        and we don't want that.
      </p>
      <h5>Quality searching</h5>
      <p>
        We want to be able to search the github issues now and in the long term and we want those searches
        to result in high quality results. As such we want issues to relate closely to actual commits.
      </p>
      <h5>Future readers</h5>
      <p>
        We want to avoid low quality issues with protracted discussions as these become much more difficult
        to read and understand
      </p>

          <h3>Ebean google group</h3>
          <p>
            Post questions or issues to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ebean">Ebean google
            group</a>. This
            is monitored by Ebean developers and it's most experienced users and here you will get the best help.
          </p>

          <h3>Stackoverflow</h3>
          <p>
            You can alternatively post questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ebean">Stack
            Overflow</a>
            tagged with <code>ebean</code>. Note that stackoverflow is more casually monitored due to time constraints.
            It
            is fine if you want to post first to stackoverflow and then if you don't get an answer to post onto the
            google
            group.
          </p>

          <h3>Github issues</h3>
          <p>
            For this project we want to use Github issues for <code>Bugs</code>, <code>Enhancements</code> and
            <code>Refactoring</code> changes. That is, things that mostly tie back to a specific commit change in code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Complex issues must be discussed on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ebean">Ebean google
              group</a>
              first to avoid spamming watchers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Questions posted to github will be closed and content cleared.
            </li>
            <li>
              Low quality issues posted to github will be closed and content cleared.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>
            In short, always post to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ebean">Ebean google group</a>
            first.
