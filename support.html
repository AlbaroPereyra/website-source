      <h3>Ebean google group</h3>
      <p>
        Post questions or issues to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ebean">Ebean google group</a>. This
        is monitored by Ebean developers and it's most experienced users and here you will get the best help.
      </p>

      <h3>Stackoverflow</h3>
      <p>
        You can alternatively post questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ebean">Stack
        Overflow</a>
        tagged with <code>ebean</code>. Note that stackoverflow is more casually monitored due to time constraints. It
        is fine if you want to post first to stackoverflow and then if you don't get an answer to post onto the google
        group.
      </p>

      <h3>Do not post a question as a github issue</h3>
      <p>
        For this project we want to use Github issues for <code>Bugs</code>, <code>Enhancements</code> and
        <code>Refactoring</code> changes.  That is, things that mostly tie back to a specific commit change in code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Posting questions to Github will restrict our ability to accurately search the Github issues for code changes
        / behavior changes and reduce the ability to browse the outstanding issues and enhancements.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Questions posted to github will be closed and content cleared so as to protect the issues register.
      </blockquote>
