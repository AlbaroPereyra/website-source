<h1 id="sessionless">Sessionless architecture</h1>
<p>
  JPA is architecture such that the entity beans must be <code>attached</code> to the <code>PersistenceContext</code>
  in order for the entity beans to be <code>persisted</code>.
</p>
<p>
  That is, JPA mandates <code>attach/detach</code> semantics. This has a number of consequences including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developers can't easily take control and persist selected objects</li>
  <li>All attached beans must be in a valid state to flush</li>
  <li>Flush implicitly flushes all dirty state (so dirty state created <em>anywhere</em> flushes implicitly)</li>
  <li>Flush can reorder statements in unexpected ways (causing deadlocks)</li>
  <li>The EntityManager scope must now be managed along with the transaction scope</li>
</ul>

<h3>Ebean persistence</h3>

<h4>Dirty state on each bean</h4>
<p>
  For Ebean each entity bean manages it's own dirty state and do not be attached to be persisted.
</p>

<h4>JDBC batch control</h4>
<p>
  Using JDBC batch is important so that Ebean can get optimal performance when persisting. With Ebean
  there is a JDBC batch buffer attached to the transaction and can seamlessly batch up persistence
  calls using JDBC batch.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean provides full control over JDBC batch via the transaction including the
  <code>batch size</code>, <code>getGeneratedKeys</code>, and <code>cascade behavior</code>.
  Unlike JPA with Ebean it is easy to fully control and optimise batch processing.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean can match JPA persistence performance without the complexity of attach/detach semantics.

<h1 id="jpql">Query language</h1>
<blockquote>
  There were no DBA's in the room when JPQL was designed :(
</blockquote>
<p>
  <code>JPQL</code> has both poor support for <code><a href="/docs/query/partialobjects">partial objects</a></code>
  and poor support for <code><a href="/docs/query/nplus1">optimising complex queries for N + 1</a></code> by defining
  what part of the object graph should be fetched.
</p>
<p>
  In it's current state <code>JPQL</code> is a poor language for optimising ORM queries. JPA 2.1 added
  in support for <code>fetch groups</code> as a query hint but there are a number of issues with this:
  being rather inelegant to use, only a query hint with relatively poor support and ultimately missing
  some important features for controlling object graph construction from mixed sources (L2, L3 and DB).
</p>
<p>
  In JPA the emphasis on annotations <code>FetchType.Eager</code> and <code>FetchType.Lazy</code>
  and limitations in JPQL has put JPA in a bad position for optimising ORM queries and it will be
  interesting if they can get to the level of control over object graph construction that Ebean supports.
</p>
<p>
  To be absolutely clear there is absolutely no intention of supporting <code>JPQL</code>.
