<h2 id="jpa">JPA</h2>
<p>
  The issues discussed in the <a href="/architecture/compare-jpa">comparison with JPA</a> also apply to Hibernate.
  The comparison here apply more specifically to Hibernate.
</p>

<h2 id="honor-maxRows">Honoring maxRows in SQL</h2>
<p>
  Ebean ORM will always honor firstRows / maxRows in generated SQL. Once you include a join fetch
  to a @OneToMany Hibernate stops implementing maxRows in SQL and instead brings all the rows back
  to the client (application server) and filters the results there.
</p>
<p>
  This means the database does not get the opportunity to optimise that query using maxRows
  (via limit offset clause or similar) and so the DB query execution plan can be very different
  by reducing the ability of the DB to use indexes and increasing the chances of full table scans.
</p>
<p>
  This also means significantly more data is pulled back from the DB to the client.

  </div>
</div>

<h2>SQL cartesian product</h2>
<p>
  Ebean ORM will never generate a SQL cartesian product.
</p>
<p>
  Hibernate generates a SQL cartesian product when you join fetch multiple @OneToMany or @ManyToMany
  associations.

<h2 id="lazyInitialisationException">LazyInitialisationException</h2>
<p>
  Hibernate does not allow lazy loading beyond the end of it's Session scope and instead
  throws <code>LazyInitialisationException</code>.
</p>
<blockquote>
  Ebean does not suffer this limitation.
</blockquote>
<h4>Ebean allows lazy loading beyond the initial scope</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    The transaction isolation level of read committed is used as per the JPA spec. This means
    there is no effective difference when we lazy load with using another JDBC transaction relative
    to holding open a transaction (as typically required by Hibernate via "Open session in view").
  </li>
  <li>
    Ebean's entity beans have a reference back to their load context which enables subsequent
    lazy loading to execute with the same PersistenceContext and also enables batch lazy loading.
    This means the lazy loading still produces a consistent object graph (just as if it was loaded
    eagerly).
  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  With Ebean lazy loading just works!
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 id="open-session-in-view">Open session in view</h1>
<p>
  As a byproduct of Ebean supporting lazy loading (beyond transaction scope) Ebean does not require
  the <code>"Open session in view"</code> pattern.
</p>
<p>
  The "Open session in view" used with Hibernate has the effect of holding a transaction open for a
  longer time relative to Ebean.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="set">Set vs List</h2>
<p>
  Hibernate has different semantics for <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code> (bag semantics).
  For Hibernate this tends to promote the use of Set as the preferred collection type.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean does not apply different semantics between <code>Set</code> and <code>List</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The issue with using <code>Set</code> is that it implies the use of <code>hashCode()/equals()</code> and the
  implementation of hashCode()/equals() is not perfect for the case of entity beans that mutate and don't
  always have an @Id value (e.g. When the @Id value is not populated via generated value and hence not
  populated until after the save and hence the @Id value can't be used in hashCode/equals implementation).
</p>
<p>
  For Ebean I'd like to promote the use of <code>List</code> in preference to <code>Set</code> in order to
  avoid any confusion relating to hashCode()/equals() implementation on mutating entity beans.
