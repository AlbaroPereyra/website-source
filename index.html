          Use JPA Mapping annotations.

        <h3>Simple to use</h3>
        <p>
          With Ebean it is very easy to insert, update, delete.
          There is no 'Session' or EntityManager to manage, no merge/flush/attach/detach semantics.

        <h3><a href="/docs/query/autotune">Automatic query tuning</a></h3>
        <p>
          Ebean can profile the object graph use and use that to <code>automatically optimise</code>
          ORM queries such that they only fetch the required properties and minimises N + 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          Want <code>horizontally scale</code> read access, text searching or just want
          some inverted index awesomeness?
        </p>
        <p>
          Have a look at <a href="/docs/features/elasticsearch">Ebean's integration</a> with
          <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">ElasticSearch</a> .

        <h3><a href="/docs/features/history">SQL2011 History support</a></h3>
        <p>
          Ebean has built in @History support for Oracle, Postgres, MySql and H2.
          This means database changes are kept for auditing or change tracking purposes
          and perform <code>historical queries</code> (what did a object graph look like last week)
          and perform <code>version queries</code> (what were all the changes to customer 42 including
          a diff for each version).

        <h3>Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Ebean has an taken a different architectural when compared with JPA and JDO and this has important implications.
          Specifically Ebean does not use a 'Persistence Context' or 'Session' when it persists objects back to the database.
          This means you don't need to attach/detach your beans or manage a JPA EntityManager or JDO PersistenceManager.
        </p>
        <p>
          Persisting a bean means you just call save(). Cascade persistence is supported by traversing the relationships
          on the bean.

        <h3>Partial Objects and N + 1</h3>
        <p>
          A high performance ORM needs good support for <a href="/docs/query/partialobjects">partial objects</a>
          (only fetching the properties needed) and optimising object graph construction to mitigate
          <a href="/docs/query/nplus1">N + 1</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ebean's query design provides a clean separation between what properties and paths to fetch and the
          rest of the query (predicates, orderBy, paging) and this makes it easy for developers to optimise
          object graph construction and also allows Ebean to <a href="/docs/query/autotune">automatically tune queries</a>
          using profiling.

        <h3>Interesting Features</h3>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Raw SQL</strong>: Using raw sql is easy and the bean returned are fully featured with
            the expected lazy loading and persisting support because sometimes you need full control
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Paging results</strong>: Use findRowCount() or findPagedList() to make handling paged results easy.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Large Query Support</strong>: Use findIterate() to process lots of objects without
            having them all in memory. Typically for batch processing requirements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Batch inserting</strong>: Ability to tune batch inserting with per-transaction control over
            JDBC batch size and the ability to turn off getGeneratedKeys and Cascade persist.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>DB Encryption</strong>: Use DB encryption transparently with @Encrypt.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>JSON support</strong>: Built in JSON support. Marshalling/unmarshalling is fully aware of
            circular relationships, inheritance, partial objects and all data types.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic Query Tuning</strong>: Has 'Autofetch' automatic query tuning support. Queries can be
            automatically optimised based on profiling the object graph use.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stateless Updates</strong>: Populate a bean object graph and then update() it without querying it
            from the DB. This is useful to support REST.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bulk Updates/Deletes</strong>: Use bulk update statements as you desire because sometimes a more
            'relational' approach is vastly more efficient - Ebean is happy with that and the L2 cache will invalidate
            the appropriate cache regions where necessary.
          </li>
