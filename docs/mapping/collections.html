<h2 id="recommendation">Recommendation - Use List</h2>
<p>
  The recommendation is to use <code>List</code> to map collection properties
  of <code>@OneToMany</code> or <code>@ManyToMany</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This means we avoid implicit use of <code>hashCode() / equals()</code> which
  occurs with the use of <code>Set</code>.
</p>

<h2 id="list">List vs Set</h2>
<h4>Hibernate bag semantics</h4>
<p>
  With Hibernate there could be a preference for using <code>Set</code> because Set and List have
  different semantics with Hibernate. Set uses "bag semantics" and is often preferred with Hibernate.
</p>

<h4>hashCode() / equals()</h4>
<p>
  Using Set by implication means that <code>hashCode()/equals()</code> implementation is used.
  This is problematic as the nature of entity beans is that they a mutating and often don't have
  an @Id value until after the bean has been persisted.
</p>
<p>
  The difficulty in implementing hashCode()/equals() on entity beans means that <code>List</code>
  is the recommended collection type to hold @OneToMany and @ManyToMany collections.
</p>

```java

@Entity
@Table(name="customer")
public class Customer extends BaseModel {
  ...

  // List is recommended for collection types

  @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer", cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
  List<Contact> contacts;
  ...
```

<h2 id="enhancement">Enhancement</h2>
<p>
  When you define a collection type enhancement will ensure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Any List/Set initialisation is removed</li>
  <li>The List/Set is always initialised by Ebean (and never null)</li>
</ul>

<h3>List/Set initialisation is removed</h3>
```java

// initialisation of the new ArrayList() is removed

@OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
List<Contact> contacts = new ArrayList<Contact>;

// you can declare an un-initialised List if you wish
// and there is no actual difference to an initialised one
// because enhancement will always initialise it

@OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
List<Contact> contacts;

```
<p>
  In Kotlin we'd typically always want to define it as being not null:
</p>
```java
  // kotlin: contacts type not nullable
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer")
  var contacts: MutableList<Contact> = ArrayList()
```

<h3>The List/Set is always initialised (never null)</h3>
<p>
  Ebean needs to control the initialisation of the List/Set in order to support:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lazy loading</li>
  <li>Support @PrivateOwned where we need the list/set to be aware of removals</li>
  <li>Support @ManyToMany where we need the list/set to be aware of adds and removals</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Enhancement ensures that whenever you access a List/Set Ebean will always
  initialise it and setup the List/Set to listen for adds/removals if necessary
  (for @PrivateOwned and @ManyToMany).
</p>
<p>
  This has the effect that accessing the list/set it will always be not null.
</p>

```java

  // it "looks" like contacts could be null ...

  @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
  List<Contact> contacts;

  public void addContact(Contact contact) {
    // but actually contacts will never be null here
    if (contacts == null) {
      contacts = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    contacts.add(contact);
  }
```
<p>
  Enhancement replaces all the <code>GETFIELD</code> instructions for <code>persistent collections</code>
  and replaces that with code that ensures the List/Set is initialised if required.
</p>

```java
  @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
  List<Contact> contacts;

  public void addContact(Contact contact) {
    // this is safe to write as contacts
    // will never be null here
    contacts.add(contact);
  }
```
