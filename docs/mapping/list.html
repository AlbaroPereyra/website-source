  <h2 id="list">List vs Set</h2>
  <p>
    For mapping collections for <code>@OneToMany</code> or <code>@ManyToMany</code> properties
    we need to choose between using <code>Set</code> or <code>List</code> for these collections.
  </p>

  <h4>Hibernate bag semantics</h4>
  <p>
    With Hibernate there could be a preference for using <code>Set</code> because Set and List have
    different semantics with Hibernate. Set uses "bag semantics" and is often preferred.
  </p>

  <h4>hashCode() / equals()</h4>
  <p>
    Using Set by implication means that <code>hashCode()/equals()</code> implementation is used.
    This is problematic as the nature of entity beans is that they a mutating and often don't have
    an @Id value until after the bean has been persisted.
  </p>
  <p>
    The difficulty in implementing hashCode()/equals() on entity beans means that <code>List</code>
    is the recommended collection type to hold @OneToMany and @ManyToMany collections.
  </p>

  ```java

  @Entity
  @Table(name="be_customer")
  public class Customer extends BaseModel {
    ...

    // List is recommended for collection types

    @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer", cascade=CascadeType.PERSIST)
    List<Contact> contacts;
    ...
  ```

  <h2 id="enhancement">Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    When you define a collection type enhancement will ensure:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Any List/Set initialisation is removed</li>
    <li>The List/Set is always initialised by Ebean (and never null)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>List/Set initialisation is removed</h3>
  ```java

  // initialisation of the new ArrayList() is removed

  @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
  List<Contact> contacts = new ArrayList<Contact>;

  // you can declare an un-initialised List if you wish
  // and there is no actual difference to an initialised one

  @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
  List<Contact> contacts;

  ```
  <p>
    In Kotlin we'd typically always want to define it as being not null:
  </p>
  ```java
    // kotlin: contacts type not nullable
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer")
    var contacts: MutableList<Contact> = ArrayList()
  ```

  <h3>The List/Set is always initialised (never null)</h3>
  <p>
    Ebean needs to control the initialisation of the List/Set in order to support:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lazy loading</li>
    <li>Support @PrivateOwned where we need the list/set to be aware of removals</li>
    <li>Support @ManyToMany where we need the list/set to be aware of adds and removals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Enhancement ensures that whenever you access a List/Set Ebean will always
    initialise it and setup the List/Set to listen for adds/removals if necessary
    (for @PrivateOwned and @ManyToMany).
  </p>
  <p>
    This has the effect that accessing the list/set.
  </p>

  ```java

    // it "looks" like contacts could be null ...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
    List<Contact> contacts;

    public void addContact(Contact contact) {
      // but actually contacts will never be null here
      if (contacts == null) {
        contacts = new ArrayList<>();
      }
      contacts.add(contact);
    }
  ```
  <p>
    Enhancement replaces all the <code>GETFIELD</code> instructions for persistent collections
    and replaces that will code that ensures the List/Set is initialised if required.
