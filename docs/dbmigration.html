  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DB Migration is a feature for generation of DDL from the entity bean model that supports determining the
    <code>diff</code> from the prior version of the model and generating appropriate DDL changes based on
    the model difference.
  </p>

  <h2 id="main-method">Main method</h2>
  <p>
    To run the <code>DbMigration</code> you should create a main method in the test source similar to
    the following code:
  </p>

```java
package main;

import com.avaje.ebean.config.dbplatform.DbPlatformName;
import com.avaje.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration;

import java.io.IOException;

public class MainDbMigration {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

    DbMigration dbMigration = new DbMigration();

    // set path that the migration xml and ddl is located
    // this defaults to standard maven src/main/resources
    //dbMigration.setPathToResources("src/main/resources");

    // Postgres as the target DB
    dbMigration.setPlatform(DbPlatformName.POSTGRES);

    // generate the migration xml and ddl
    dbMigration.generateMigration();
  }
}
```
  <p>
    When the DbMigration is run it loads any prior migration xml and combines that together
    to define the prior model which is then compared against the existing entity beans.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <code>migration xml</code> document is generated which represents the <code>diff</code>
    to the logical model and from that DDL scripts are generated
  </p>


  <h2 id="migration-xml">Migration xml</h2>
  <p>
    When DbMigration is run if there is a diff detected a migration xml document is generated.
    The diff can have <code>apply</code> changes or <code>drop</code> tables.
  </p>
  <p>
    The migration xml represents the <code>diff</code> to the model. Note that the changes
    in the migration xml are database agnostic and a single migration xml document can be used
    to generate migration DDL for multiple databases. For example, generate migration DDL
    scripts for Postgres, Oracle and SQL Server from the single migration xml.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the migration xml DDL scripts are generated for <code>apply</code>, <code>applyRollback</code>
    and <code>drop</code>.
  </p>

  <h4>Example migration xml</h4>
  <p>
    Below is an example migration xml generated with <code>apply</code> changes. The customer table
    has 2 new columns added to it.
  </p>
```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
  <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
    <changeSet type="apply">
      <addColumn tableName="customer">
        <column name="registered" type="date"/>
        <column name="comments" type="varchar(1000)"/>
      </addColumn>
    </changeSet>
  </migration>
```

  <h4>Example migration drop changes</h4>
  <p>
    Below is an example migration xml generated with <code>drop</code> changes.
  </p>
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
  <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
    <changeSet type="drop">
      <dropColumn columnName="comments" tableName="customer"/>
    </changeSet>
  </migration>
  ```

  <h2 id="apply-ddl">Apply DDL</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>apply</code> ddl script contains the changes that are deemed non-destructive
    so adding tables, adding columns, adding indexes etc.
  </p>

  <h2 id="apply-rollback-ddl">Apply Rollback DDL</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>applyRollback</code> ddl script contains DDL to reverse or undo the <code>apply</code> changes.
    Some databases support transactional DDL and if the apply DDL can be run in a transactional manor then
    the applyRollback script is not necessary. The <code>applyRollback</code> ddl script is always generated
    (even if the DB supports transactional DDL) and you can use it as required or not.
  </p>

  <h2 id="drop-ddl">Drop DDL</h2>
  <p>
    The <code>drop</code> ddl script contains DDL that is considered destructive such as <code>drop table</code>
    and <code>drop column</code>. These types of changes are not expected to be able to be run automatically in
    production with the apply changes as typically the existing application will remain running and as such the
    existing application is potentially using those tables/columns that are to be dropped and so it is expected
    that the <code>drop</code> changes can not be applied until the application has been upgraded.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is, unless outage is scheduled the drop changes need to trail the apply changes by at least 1 version.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases the <code>drop</code> changes are actually not run for weeks or longer (or not at all even)
    until such time that it is known the application does not need to revert etc.
