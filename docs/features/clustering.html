    <h3>Note: (as per 7.5.1)</h3>
    <p>
      As per version 7.5.1 the clustering support has been refactored and pulled into a separate module.
      By default avaje-ebeanorm-cluster is included as a dependency and uses TCP sockets for cluster communication.
    </p>

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      When Ebean servers are running in a cluster then it is the job of the clustering support to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Notify L2 cache invalidation events</li>
      <li>Notify BeanPersistListeners (of remote insert/update/delete events)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When a transaction commits the events that will result in cache invalidation or have registered
      BeanPersistListeners are collected into a <code>RemoteTransactionEvent</code> and this event
      is broadcast to all the members in the cluster. Each member then processes the event invalidating
      parts of the local L2 cache and invoking listeners as necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>L2 cache invalidation</h2>
    <p>
      For details on L2 cache invalidation refer to <a href="/docs/features/l2caching#table-iud-invalidation">Table IUD</a> invalidation
      and <a href="/docs/features/l2caching#bean-iud-invalidation">Bean IUD</a> invalidation.
    </p>

    <h2>Cluster message</h2>
    <p>
      The message send around the cluster is a <code>RemoteTransactionEvent</code> which contains information for
      Table IUD bulk changes and Bean IUD events.
    </p>

    <h4>Table IUD message</h4>
    <p>
      For bulk table insert, update or delete events the message contains the table name and boolean flags for insert,
      update and delete.
    </p>

    <h4>Bean IUD message</h4>
    <p>
      For bean insert, update or delete events the message contains the bean type (class name) and a list of id values
      for inserted, updated and deleted beans.
    </p>


    <h2>Configuration</h2>
    <p>
      By default clustering support is included via a dependency on <code>avaje-ebeanorm-cluster</code> so we just
      need to configure it. The example properties below show the configuration for a 3 node cluster.
    </p>
    ```properties
    ebean.cluster.active=true

    ## the host:port for this node
    ebean.cluster.localHostPort=127.0.0.1:9942

    ## all the members of the cluster
    ebean.cluster.members=127.0.0.1:9942,127.0.0.1:9943,127.0.0.1:9944
    ```
    <p>
      Each member of the cluster should configure their unique <code>localHostPort</code> value.
    </p>

    <h2>Logging</h2>
    <p>
      At <code>INFO</code> level logging on <code>org.avaje.ebean.Cluster</code> messages are output
      when clustering starts, stops and members leave or join.
    </p>
  ```sh
  INFO  org.avaje.ebean.Cluster - Clustering using local[127.0.0.1:9943] members[[127.0.0.1:9942, 127.0.0.1:9943]]
  ```
  ```sh
  INFO  org.avaje.ebean.Cluster - Register as online with member [localhost:9942]
  ```
  ```sh
  INFO  org.avaje.ebean.Cluster - Cluster member [localhost:9943] online[true]
  ```

  <p>
    At <code>DEBUG</code> level messages are logged for sending and receiving events.
  </p>
  ```sh
  DEBUG org.avaje.ebean.Cluster - sending: [org.example.domain.Customer updateIds:[4]]
  ```
  ```sh
  DEBUG org.avaje.ebean.Cluster - processing [org.example.domain.Customer updateIds:[4]]
  ```


  <h4>Other notes</h4>
  <p>The <a href="/apidocs/com/avaje/ebean/event/AbstractBeanPersistListener.html">BeanPersistListener</a> listens for committed bean events.</p>

  <p>These listen events occur after a successful commit. They also occur in a background thread rather than the thread used to perform the actual insert update or delete. In this way there is a delay between the commit and when the listener is notified of the event.</p>

  <p>For a cluster these events may need to be broadcast. Each of the inserted(), updated() and deleted() methods return true if you want those events to be broadcast to the other members of a cluster (the id values are broadcast). If these methods return false then the events are not broadcast.</p>

  <p>
    Ebean.externalModification(String tableName, boolean inserted, boolean updated, boolean deleted) processes committed changes from another framework or clustered server
  </p>

  <p>
  Calling Ebean.externalModification notifies Ebean that beans have been committed externally, either by another framework or clustered server. Ebean uses this information to maintain its cache and lucene indexes appropriately.
