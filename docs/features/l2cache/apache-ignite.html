  <h2>Apache Ignite</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Apache Ignite</a> provides a very nice set of features for
    distributed caching (which is what we use it for with L2 caching) plus "Data grid" features.
  </p>
  <p>
    My expectation is that most people will prefer client/server mode with use of near caches.
  </p>

  <h3 id="client-server">Client/server mode</h3>
  <p>
    We can use Ignite in <code>client/server</code> mode which means that our application uses a
    <code>Ignite client</code> to talk to a Ignite cluster (of servers).
  </p>
  <p>
    In this mode the bean cache data is partitioned across all the Ignite servers in the cluster
    and not in our application. We can choose to use a <code>near cache</code> for some or all of our bean
    types and in doing so improve performance (by having local data) but increase memory footprint in our
    application (as it now holds some cache data).
  </p>

  <h3 id="server-mode">Server mode</h3>
  <p>
    In server mode our application starts a <code>Ignite server instance</code> which is a full fledged member
    of the Ignite cluster. This means that it will hold data etc.
  </p>


  <h3 id="dependency">Dependency</h3>
  <p>
    Add a dependency to <code>ebean-ignite</code>. When Ebean starts ebean-ignite is
    automatically registered as the L2 cache implementation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="disable">Disable L2 cache</h3>
  <p>
    During development and testing it is often useful to disable the use of the l2 cache.
  </p>

  <h5>Properties</h5>
  ```properties
  ## disable use of L2 cache (for dev / testing etc)
  ebean.disableL2Cache=true
  ```
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>

  <h3>XML configuration</h3>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>Programmatic configuration</h3>
  <p>
    You can programmatically configure Ignite by creating an instance of <code>IgniteConfiguration</code>
    and setting it via: <code></code>
  </p>
  ```java
  IgniteConfiguration configuration = ...;
  serverConfig.setServiceObject("igniteConfiguration", configuration);
  ```
  <p>
    If this configuration instance is passed in Ebean will use it to configure the Ignite instance.
    Otherwise it will use properties and avaje IgniteConfigBuilder.
  </p>

  <h3 id="getting-started">Getting started</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Annotate beans with @Cache</li>
    <li>Add maven dependency ebean-ignite</li>
    <li>Optionally add ebean-ignite-config.xml</li>
    <li>For client/server mode you need a running Ignite server</li>
  </ul>
