  <h2 id="setUseQueryCache">setUseQueryCache(true)</h2>
  <p>
    To use the query cache you have to <code>explicitly</code> specify its use on a query.
  </p>

  ```java
  // use the query cache
  List<Country> list = Ebean.find(Country.class)
    .setUseQueryCache(true)
    .where().ilike("name", "New%")
    .findList();
  ```
  <p>
    The query cache is generally useful for returning lists that are very infrequently changed.
    These lists would often be used to populate drop down lists / combo boxes in user interfaces.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are familiar with the term "Lookup Tables" or "Reference Tables" these are typical candidates
    for using cached queries. Some examples of lookup/reference tables could be, countries, currencies
    and order status.
  </p>
  <p>
    Query cache lists are read only.
  </p>

  <h2 id="cacheQueryTuning">@CacheQueryTuning</h2>
  <p>
    All query caching implementations (including Hazelcast and Apache Ignite) uses near caches
    and can be tuned using <code>@CacheQueryTuning</code>.
  </p>

  ```java
  @CacheStrategy
  @CacheQueryTuning(maxSecsToLive = 30)
  @Entity
  public class Product  {
  ```
