  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a> provides a very nice set of features for
    distributed caching (which is what we use it for with L2 caching) plus "Data grid" features.
  </p>
  <p>
    My expectation is that most people will prefer client/server mode with use of near caches.
  </p>

  <h2 id="client-server">Client/server mode</h2>
  <p>
    We can use Hazelcast in <code>client/server</code> mode which means that our application uses a
    <code>Hazelcast client</code> to talk to a Hazelcast cluster (of servers).
  </p>
  <p>
    In this mode the bean cache data is partitioned across all the Hazelcast servers in the cluster
    and not in our application. We can choose to use a <code>near cache</code> for some or all of our bean
    types and in doing so improve performance (by having local data) but increase memory footprint in our
    application (as it now holds some cache data).
  </p>

  <h5>Configuration</h5>
  <p>
    For client/server mode the configuration file should be a <code>hazelcast-client.xml</code>
  </p>

  <h2 id="server-mode">Server mode</h2>
  <p>
    In server mode our application starts a <code>Hazelcast server instance</code> which is a full fledged member
    of the Hazelcast cluster. This means that it will hold data etc.
  </p>

  <h5>Configuration</h5>
  <p>
    For server mode the configuration file should be a <code>hazelcast.xml</code>.
  </p>



  <h2 id="dependency">Dependency</h2>
  <p>
    Add a dependency to <code>ebean-hazelcast</code>. When Ebean starts ebean-hazelcast is
    automatically registered as the L2 cache implementation.
  </p>

  <h2 id="disable">Disable L2 cache</h2>
  <p>
    During development and testing it is often useful to disable the use of the l2 cache.
  </p>

  <h5>Properties</h5>
  ```properties
  ## disable use of L2 cache (for dev / testing etc)
  ebean.disableL2Cache=true
  ```
  <p>

  </p>

  <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

  <h4>XML configuration</h4>
  <p>
    Hazelcast will operate without any configuration but typically you will want to add a <code>hazelcast-client.xml</code>
    or <code>hazelcast.xml</code> configuration for client/server or server mode respectively.
  </p>
  <p>
    In hazelcast-client.xml you can specify the use of <code>near cache</code> for example which is a common need.
  </p>

  <h4>Programmatic configuration</h4>
  <p>
    You can programmatically configure Hazelcast by creating an instance of Hazelcast <code>ClientConfig</code> or
    <code>Config</code> and setting it via: <code></code>
  </p>
  ```java
  ClientConfig configuration = ...;
  serverConfig.setServiceObject("hazelcastConfiguration", configuration);
  ```
  <p>
    If this configuration instance is passed in Ebean will use it to configure a Hazelcast client or server instance.
    Otherwise it will use default configuration and Hazelcast will automatically search for and use the xml configuration
    files.
  </p>

  <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Annotate beans with @CacheStrategy</li>
    <li>Add maven dependency ebean-hazelcast</li>
    <li>Optionally add hazelcast-client.xml or hazelcast.xml</li>
    <li>For client/server mode you need a running Hazelcast server</li>
  </ul>
