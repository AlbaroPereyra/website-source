  <h2 id="read-only-instances">Read only instances</h2>
  <p>
    For a performance optimisation when using the cache you can inform Ebean that you
    want "read only" entities. If you ask for "read only" entities Ebean can give you the
    instance that is in the cache rather than creating a new copy (creating a new instance and
    copying the data from the cached instance).
  </p>
  <p>
    To be safe in allowing many threads to share the same instances (from the cache) Ebean
    ensures that these instances can not be mutated. It sets flags (sharedInstance=true,
    readOnly=true) and any attempt to modify the entity (via setters or putfields) results in an
    IllegalStateException being thrown.
  </p>

  ```java
  // Cache countries. Use readOnly=true so unless explicitly
  // stated in the query we will return read only/shared instances
  @CacheStrategy(readOnly=true)
  @Entity
  @Table(name="o_country")
  public class Country {
  ```

  <p>
    Note that Countries is a good candidate for a default setting of readOnly=true. This is
    because (for my application) country information is very rarely changed. The application
    code mostly treats the countries as read only.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, whenever we get a country (via direct query or indirectly via relationships/joins) unless
    we explictly say query.setReadOnly(false) we are going to get back readOnly instances that
    we will not be able to mutate.
  </p>

  ```java
  // we will use the cache .. and the instance
  // in the cache is returned to us (not a copy)
  Country country = Ebean.find(Country.class, "NZ");

  // this country instance is readOnly
  Assert.assertTrue(Ebean.getBeanState(country).isReadOnly());
  try {
    // we can't modify a readOnly bean
    // … a IllegalStateException is thrown
    country.setName("Nu Zilund");
    Assert.assertFalse("Never get here",true);
  } catch (IllegalStateException e){
    Assert.assertTrue("This is readOnly",true);
  }

  // explicitly state we want a MUTABLE COPY
  // … not the same instance as the one in cache
  // … a copy is made and returned instead
  Country countryCopy = Ebean.find(Country.class)
  .setReadOnly(false)
  .setId("NZ")
  .findOne();

  // we can mutate this one
  countryCopy.setName("Nu Zilund");

  // save it, automatically maintaining the cache ...
  // evicting NZ from the Country bean cache and
  // clearing the Country query cache
  Ebean.save(countryCopy);
  ```

  <h2 id="shared-instances">Shared instances</h2>
  <p>
    Ebean sets a sharedInstance flag on a bean whenever it is put into the cache. This is
    used to ensure that the bean is always treated in a read only fashion (and can be safely
    shared by multiple threads concurrently).
  </p>

  <p>
    You can invoke lazy loading on a sharedInstance. When that occurs the sharedInstance
    flag is propagated to the lazily loaded beans. If you lazy load a collection (list, set or map)
    then the collection is also marked with the sharedInstance flag and that means you can't
    add or remove elements from the collection (list, set or map).
  </p>

  <p>
    A sharedInstance and all its associated beans and collections are are all ensured to be
    read only and can be safely shared by multiple threads concurrently.
