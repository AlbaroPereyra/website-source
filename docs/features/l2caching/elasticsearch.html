  <h2>TODO</h2>
  <p>
    Currently ElasticSearch is not used transparently in L2 caching but we want it to because
    it does a surprisingly good job in bean caching (GETs/PUTs) and also gives us an alternative
    approach to query caching with the use of inverted indexes (which is what we don't get via
    Hazelcast / Ignite although there might be some debate about that).
