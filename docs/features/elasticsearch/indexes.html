  <h2 id="aliases">Aliases</h2>
  <p>
    It is expected that <code>Aliases</code> are used for most processing
    rather than the direct index name.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is, there will be an alias say "customer" and that will initially map
    to the "customer_v1" index and over time there might be a change in mapping,
    re-indexing etc and the "customer" alias points to "customer_v2", "customer_v3" etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ebean generates "versioned" (*_v1) index mapping files and when using <code>dropCreate=true</code>
    it will create indexes with the version suffix (_v1) and also create an alias to those indexes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as with large OLTP databases re-indexing can be relatively expensive and take significant
    time and there are devops component/effort around maintaining indexes and aliases.
    Ebean provides some features to help in this area.
  </p>

  <h2>Indexing by partition</h2>
  <p>
    It would be useful in some cases to be able to index by a partition like day, week, month etc.
    This is currently not supported.
  </p>

  <h2 id="createIndex">Create index</h2>

  <p>
    Creates an index with the option of also creating an alias to map to the index.
  </p>
  <p>
    This will load an associated mapping file as a resource from the class path.
  </p>

  ```java

  // create a new index without an alias
  // ... the mapping is loaded from classpath as a resource
  documentStore.createIndex("product_copy", null);

  ```

  <h2 id="dropIndex">Drop index</h2>
  <p>
    Drop a index.
  </p>

  ```java
  documentStore.dropIndex("product_copy");
  ```
  <h2 id="copyIndex">Copy index</h2>
  <p>
    This does not hit the database but instead uses an ElasticSearch <code>scroll</code> query
    to go through the ElasticSearch index and use the index source to send to the destination index.
  </p>
  <p>
    This could be used as part of a devops index migration task.
  </p>
  <h4>Example: Copy index - All</h4>
  ```java
  // scroll the product index sending the source documents to "product_copy"
  long docCount = documentStore.copyIndex(Product.class, "product_copy");
  ```

  <h4>Example: Copy index - Query</h4>
  <p>
    You can specify a query filter such that only part of the index is copied.
    This could be used to update an index with recent changes or to partition
    a single index copy task into multiple tasks that could be executed in parallel.
  </p>
  ```java
  Query<Product> query = server.find(Product.class)
    .where()
    .ge("whenModified", new Timestamp(since))
    .istartsWith("sku", "c")
    .query();

  int bulkBatchSize = 1000;
  long docCount = documentStore.copyIndex(query, "product_copy", bulkBatchSize);
  ```


  <h2 id="indexAll">Index all</h2>
  <p>
    This uses the database as the "source" and will execute a <code>findEach</code> query to
    iterate all the rows (ORM graphs actually) and index them.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is expected to be more useful for testing and during development.
  </p>

  ```java
  // query all countries and index them
  documentStore.indexAll(Country.class);
  ```

  <h2 id="indexByQuery">Index by query</h2>
  <p>
    This is similar to indexAll by using the database as the "source" and will execute a
    <code>findEach</code> query to iterate all the rows (ORM graphs) and index them.
  </p>
  ```java
  Query<Product> query = server.find(Product.class)
    .where()
    .ge("whenModified", new Timestamp(since))
    .startsWith("sku", "C")
    .query();

    server.docStore().indexByQuery(query, 1000);
  ```
