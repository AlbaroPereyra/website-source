  <p>
    It is expected that <code>Aliases</code> are used for most processing
    rather than the direct index name.
  </p>
  <p>
    That is, there will be an alias say "customer" and that will initially map
    to the "customer_v1" index and over time there might be a change in mapping,
    re-indexing etc and the "customer" alias points to "customer_v2", "customer_v3" etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ebean generates "versioned" (*_v1) index mapping files and when using <code>dropCreate=true</code>
    it will create indexes with the version suffix (_v1) and also create an alias to those indexes.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just as with large OLTP databases re-indexing can be relatively expensive and take significant
    time and there are devops component/effort around maintaining indexes and aliases.
    Ebean provides some features to help in this area.
