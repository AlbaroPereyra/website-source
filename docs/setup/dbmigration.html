  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>
    DB Migration is a feature for generation of DDL from the entity bean model that supports determining the
    <code>diff</code> from the prior version of the model and generating appropriate DDL changes based on
    the model difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are expected to run the <code>diff</code> DDL using <code>FlywayDb</code>, <code>LiquiBase</code>
    or similar tool. In the future Ebean will likely have built in support to run the DDL as it already has
    most of the capability and could address some current issues with developer workflow and DDL script ordering.
  </p>
  <p>
    DB migration has 2 output files:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Migration model XML</b> - This has the logical diff of the model as an <code>apply</code> or <code>pendingDrops</code> change set</li>
    <li><b>Apply SQL</b> - This is the DDL script of the apply changes</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    When the DbMigration is run it loads any prior migration xml and combines that together
    to define the prior model which is then compared against the existing entity beans.
  </p>

  <h4>Pending Drops</h4>
  <p>
    Only non-destructive changes are included in <code>apply</code> and changes like <code>drop table</code> and
    <code>drop column</code> are put into a <code>pendingDrops</code> changeSet.
  </p>
  <p>
    The drop pending changes need to be explicitly selected to go into a migration.
  </p>
  <p>
    Given applications running in a clustered environment, pending drops typically need to trail the normal apply
    changes by at least 1 migration. This delay could be minutes, days and some drops might not ever be run.
  </p>


  <h2 id="migration-xml">Migration xml</h2>
  <p>
    When DbMigration is run the <code>diff</code> to the model is determined and output
    as the migration model xml document. This diff can have <code>apply</code> changes or <code>pendingDrops</code> changes.
  </p>
  <p>
    From the migration <code>apply</code> changeSet the actual DDL that will be applied is generated.
  </p>

  <h4>Logical changes</h4>
  <p>
    Note that the changes
    in the migration xml are database agnostic and a single migration xml document can be used
    to generate migration DDL for multiple databases. For example, you can generate migration DDL
    scripts for Postgres, Oracle and SQL Server from the single migration xml. In the migration xml
    you will see logical types like JSON types (storing JSON documents in the DB) and for Postgres
    that could translate to a JSONB and for Oracle to a CLOB.
  </p>
  <p>
    The changes are also "logical" in the sense that changes to entities with @History and @Draftable
    typically translates into multiple changes. For example adding a property to a @History entity could
    add a column to the base table, add a column to the history table and a change the triggers as required.
  </p>

  <h4>Example migration xml</h4>
  <p>
    Below is an example migration xml generated with <code>apply</code> changes. The customer table
    has 2 new columns added to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the customer table has @History support this could also add columns to the history table and
    update the associated db triggers.
  </p>
```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
  <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
    <changeSet type="apply">
      <addColumn tableName="customer">
        <column name="registered" type="date"/>
        <column name="comments" type="varchar(1000)"/>
      </addColumn>
    </changeSet>
  </migration>
```

  <h4>Example migration with pendingDrops</h4>
  <p>
    Below is an example migration xml generated with <code>pendingDrops</code> changes.
  </p>
  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
  <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
    <changeSet type="pendingDrops">
      <dropColumn columnName="shortTitle" tableName="document" withHistory="true"/>
    </changeSet>
  </migration>
  ```
  <p>
    Pending drop changes are not incorporated into the apply DDL script unless they are explicitly selected.
    Once pending drops are applied they drop off the 'pending drops' list.
  </p>

  <h2 id="apply-ddl">Apply DDL</h2>
  <p>
    The apply ddl script contains the changes that we want to apply to the database.
    This is the DDL script that you get FlywayDB or similar to run.
  </p>

  <h2>Applying pending drops</h2>

  ```sh
  INFO  c.a.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration - Pending un-applied drops in versions [1.2]
  ```

  <p>
    The DB migration will log <code>INFO</code> level messages saying which migrations contain
    pending drops that have not yet been applied.  At some point it is decided to apply one of
    the pending drops as the next migration.
  </p>

  ```java
  // generate a migration as the drops from migration version "1.2"
  System.setProperty("ddl.migration.pendingDrop", "1.2");

  DbMigration dbMigration = new DbMigration();
  dbMigration.setPlatform(DbPlatformName.POSTGRES);
  dbMigration.generateMigration();
  ```
  <p>
    A migration is then generated with <code>dropsFor</code> set to the version of the migration that
    had the pending drops that we want to apply.  Additionally the migration apply ddl contains the
    various drop statements that will be executed.
  </p>

  ```xml
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
  <migration xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/dbmigration">
    <changeSet type="apply" dropsFor="1.2">
      <dropColumn columnName="shortTitle" tableName="document" withHistory="true"/>
    </changeSet>
  </migration>
  ```


  <h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>
  <p>
    In terms of a developers workflow, the expectation is that a migration is associated with a merge request
    (git flow feature). A feature requires certain changes to the model (add a property/column) and the DB
    migration change (DDL to add columns etc) and the actual code changes are all in the same merge request
    (git flow feature branch). The developer working on their feature runs the DB migration such that they have
    the DDL changes required to support that feature.
  </p>

  <h2 id="versioning">Versioning</h2>
  <p>
    The "version" numbering format supported is the same as FlywayDB version numbering.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a "git flow feature" workflow a decent versioning schema is to take the pom version and append a number
    to represent the feature and take the form:
  </p>
```xml
  {pom version}_{feature number}_{feature name}

  So for:
    pom version = 4.5.6
    feature number = 12
    feature name = support end dating

  The resulting apply sql is:
    4.5.6_12__support-end-dating.sql

```
  <p>
    The versioning is important for your development workflow (how you process merge requests in terms
    of ordering) and the related restrictions in terms of running DDL changes in order.
    For example, in the case of FlywayDB you need to take into
    account if you allow out of order execution of the sql and this directly effects if you all
  </p>

  <h4>Future enhancement:</h4>
  <p>
    It is possible to resolve issues around DDL execution order and how that can badly impact development workflow
    (how merge requests are handled) by somehow defining a dependency between sql scripts (for example, define
    that 4.5.6_12 is dependent on 4.5.6_4) and supporting that via Ebean itself or enhancing FlywayDB.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is certainly an issue here which could be addressed with some effort in order to get both safety in
    processing DDL in order and allow flexibility in the order with which merge requests are processed.
  </p>

  <h2 id="version">Migration version and name</h2>
  <p>
    For a migration the developer needs to provide the <code>version</code> and <code>name</code>
    and these can be set via environment variables, system properties or ebean.properties or programmatically.
  </p>
  ```java
  System.setProperty("ddl.migration.generate", "true");

  System.setProperty("ddl.migration.version", "4.5.6_12");
  System.setProperty("ddl.migration.name", "support end dating");
  ```


  <h2 id="on-startup">Generating migration on startup</h2>
  <p>
    The DB migration can be generated when the EbeanServer instance is started by setting <code>ddl.migration.generate</code>
    system property or environment variable to true.
  </p>

  ```java
  @Test
  public void generate() {

    System.setProperty("ddl.migration.generate", "true");
    System.setProperty("ddl.migration.version", "4.5.6_12");
    System.setProperty("ddl.migration.name", "support end dating");

    // migration will be generated when EbeanServer instance starts
    Ebean.getDefaultServer();
  }
  ```

  <h2 id="programmatic">Generating migration programmatically</h2>
  <p>
    You can generate the a migration programmatically. For example by a main method in a class in
    the test source similar to the following code:
  </p>

  ```java
  package main;

  import com.avaje.ebean.config.dbplatform.DbPlatformName;
  import com.avaje.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration;

  import java.io.IOException;

  public class MainDbMigration {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

      DbMigration dbMigration = new DbMigration();

      // set path that the migration xml and ddl is located
      // this defaults to standard maven src/main/resources
      //dbMigration.setPathToResources("src/main/resources");

      // Postgres as the target DB
      dbMigration.setPlatform(DbPlatformName.POSTGRES);

      // generate the migration xml and ddl
      dbMigration.generateMigration();
    }
  }
  ```
