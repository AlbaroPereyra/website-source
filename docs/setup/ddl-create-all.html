  <p>
    Ebean has the ability to generate and execute <code>CREATE ALL</code> and <code>DROP ALL</code> DDL
    scripts which create all the tables. These are typically used when running tests and frequently these tests
    run against H2 database rather than the target Postgres/Oracle/MySql/SQL Server ... database.
    That is, when running a test or suite of tests the DB is created entirely from scratch.

  <p>
    Usually you set both <code>ebean.ddl.generate</code> and <code>ebean.ddl.run</code> to true in the
    <code>test-ebean.properties</code> (which is in src/test/resources) and in this way the <code>CREATE ALL</code>
    DDL is only generated and executed when running tests.
  </p>

```properties
  ebean.ddl.generate=true
  ebean.ddl.run=true
```

  <h2>DB Migration</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="dbmigration">DB Migration</a> is different in that <code>DIFF</code> DDL scripts are generated for the changes to the model
    and these <code>DIFF</code> DDL scripts can be applied to the target Postgres/Oracle/MySql/SQL Server ... database and
    often <code>FlywayDb</code> or <code>Liquibase</code> is used to apply those DDL changes.
