<h2>SavePoints (inside a transaction)</h2>

<p>
Ebean supports using <code>SavePoints</code> which are a feature of most Relational Databases
in which you can create a "Save Point" inside a transaction to which you can rollback to in case of an error (or some other logic you want)
and are exposed via the <code>JDBC</code> driver.
</p>

<p>
If you have a batch job that needs to perform certain operations, but can fail at some point, but you don't want to loose all the work, <code>SavePoints</code> might be a tool for that. You can check more information on <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/transactions.html#set_roll_back_savepoints'>Oracle's JDBC tutorial</a>
</p>

Example of using a <code>SavePoint</code>
```java
  Customer newCustomer = new Customer();
  newCustomer.setName("John");
  Ebean.save(newCustomer);

  try (Transaction transaction = Ebean.beginTransaction()) {

    Connection connection = transaction.getConnection();
    // Create a Save Point
    Savepoint savepoint = connection.setSavepoint();

    newCustomer.setName("Doe");
    Ebean.save(newCustomer);

    // Rollback to a specific save point
    connection.rollback(savepoint);
    transaction.commit();
  }

  Customer found = Ebean.find(Customer.class, newCustomer.getId());
  System.out.println(found.getName()); // Prints "John"

```
