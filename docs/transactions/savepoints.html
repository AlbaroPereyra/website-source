<h2>Savepoint</h2>

<p>
  Ebean supports using <code>Savepoints</code> which are a feature of most Relational Databases
  in which you can create a "Save point" inside a transaction to which you can rollback to in
  case of an error or some other business logic.
</p>

<p>
  If you have part of a task that performs some operations which can fail/rollback, but we don't
  want to loose all the work, <code>Savepoint</code> provides a mechanism to do this.
  You can check more information on <a href='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/transactions.html#set_roll_back_savepoints'>Oracle's JDBC tutorial</a>
</p>

<h3>Transaction.setNestedUseSavepoint()</h3>
<p>

  For a transaction we can use <code>setNestedUseSavepoint()</code> to enable it to use
  <code>Savepoint</code> for nested transactions. This means that these nested transactions
  can be rolled back but leaving the outer transaction to continue and potentially commit.
</p>

<h5>Example</h5>
```java

// start 'outer' transaction
try (Transaction outerTxn = server.beginTransaction()) {

  outerTxn.setNestedUseSavepoint();

  // do stuff with the 'outer' transaction
  bean.save();

  try (Transaction nestedTransaction = server.beginTransaction()) {
    // nested transaction is a savepoint ...

    // do some piece of work which we might want to either commit or rollback ...
    otherBean.save();

    if (...) {
      nestedTransaction.rollback();

    } else {
      nestedTransaction.commit();
    }
  }

  // continue using 'outer' transaction ...

  outerTxn.commit();
}

```
