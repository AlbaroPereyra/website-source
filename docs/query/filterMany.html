<h2>filterMany (filter properties on a hasMany relation)</h2>

<p>
This applies a filter on the 'many' property list (a <code>hasMany</code> relation) rather than the root
 level objects.
 </p>
 <p>
 Typically you will use this in a scenario where the cardinality is high on
 the 'many' property you wish to join to. Say you want to fetch customers
 and their associated orders... but instead of getting all the orders for
 each customer you only want to get the new orders they placed since last
 week. In this case you can use <code>filterMany()</code> to filter the orders.
 </p>
 ```java

 List<Customer> list =
     ebeanServer.find(Customer.class)
     .fetch("orders")
     .where()
     .ilike("name", "rob%")
     .filterMany("orders").eq("status", Order.Status.NEW).gt("orderDate", lastWeek)
     .findList();

 ```
 <p>
 <strong>Please note you have to be careful that you add expressions to the correct
 expression list - as there is one for the 'root level' and one for each
 filterMany that you have.</strong>
