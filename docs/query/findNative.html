<h3>findNative</h3>
<p>
  With <code>findNative</code> we supply the SQL.  The SQL can contain positioned parameters with <code>?</code>
  used for bind parameters or we can use named parameters like <code>:foo</code>
</p>
```java

    Customer customer =

      nativeSql("select id, name from customer where name like ?")
        .setParameter(1, "Jo%")
        .findOne();
```
<p>
  An example using named parameters.
</p>
```java
  List<Customer> customers =

    nativeSql("select id, name from customer where name like :name order by name desc")
      .setParameter("name", "Jo%")
      .findList();
```
<p>
  With the above examples we are selecting <b>some</b> columns and as a result getting
  <b>partially populated entity beans</b> (which is good - we should only fetch things out of the DB
  that we need).
</p>
<p>
  We can use <code>select *</code> if we desire all the columns.
</p>
```java
  List<Customer> customers =

    nativeSql("select * from customer where name like :name order by name desc")
      .setParameter("name", "Jo%")
      .findList();
```
<h3>Internal workings</h3>
<p>
  The way this works is that when a query is first run the JDBC meta data is read for the
  columns in the resultSet and then these columns are automatically mapped to bean properties.
</p>
<p>
  This only needs to be done for the first execution of the query. How the query is mapped to
  beans is cached so we only need to read the JDBC resultSet meta data once per query.
</p>

<h3>Oracle limitation</h3>
<p>
  There is a limitation with the Oracle JDBC driver in that the meta data currently does not include
  the table that a column relates to. This means that with Oracle we can only map a single table
  and not multiple tables (and would have to use <a href="/docs/query/rawSql">RawSql</a> instead).
</p>

<h3>Multiple tables</h3>
<p>
  Excluding Oracle our SQL can select from multiple tables and these can automatically be mapped.
</p>
<p>
  For example, we can fetch and populate 2 related beans like Customer and Contact.
</p>
```java
  // Contacts + Customer
  String sql
    = "select ct.id, ct.first_name, ct.last_name, cu.id, cu.name " +
    " from contact ct " +
    " join customer cu on cu.id = ct.customer_id " +
    " order by ct.first_name desc";

  List<Contact> contacts =

    nativeSql(sql)
      .findList();
```
<h5>Limitation</h5>
<p>
  The limitation with using findNative (excluding Oracle) is that it can only map multiple tables when the path
  for a given table is unique. For example, lets say we have Customer that maps both a billingAddress and shippingAddress
  to the Address. When ebean tries to map a column for the address table it does not know which path (billingAddress or
  shippingAddress) the column maps to.
</p>
<p>
  When we hit this limitation we need to use <a href="/docs/query/rawSql">RawSql</a> instead where we can map more
  explicitly.
