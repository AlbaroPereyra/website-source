<h3>fetch</h3>
<p>
  With fetch you specify the properties that should be fetched on the associated beans.
</p>
<p>
  Any node of the object graph can be a partial object. This example shows several ways partial
  objects can be fetched.
</p>

```java
Order order = Order.find
.select("status, orderDate, shipDate") // 3 fields from order
.fetch("customer", "name") // just name field from customer
.fetch("details") // all fields from details
.fetch("details.product", "sku") // just sku field from product
.where().idEq(1L)
.findOne();
```
```sql

select
  t0.id c0, t0.status c1, t0.order_date c2, t0.ship_date c3,
  t1.id c4, t1.name c5, -- customer name
  t2.id c6, t2.order_qty c7, t2.ship_qty c8, t2.unit_price c9, t2.version c10,
  t2.when_created c11, t2.when_updated c12, t2.order_id c13,
  t3.id c14, t3.sku c15 -- product sku
from orders t0
join customer t1 on t1.id = t0.customer_id
left outer join order_detail t2 on t2.order_id = t0.id
left outer join product t3 on t3.id = t2.product_id
where t0.id = ?
order by t0.id, t2.id asc; --bind(1)
```

<h2 id="query_joins">Query joins</h2>
<h4>
  Controlling eager loading of the object graph using query joins.
</h4>

<p>You can use fetch() to explicitly state which additional paths you want to fetch. You would do
  this to reduce "lazy loading" of those beans later.</p>

<p>
  When more than 1 OneToMany or ManyToMany relationship is eagerly fetched
  then Ebean will automatically convert one of those into a 'Query Join'. Ebean does this so that it
  avoids
  generating a cartesian product query. Note that Ebean determines the type of SQL join for you
  based on the cardinality and optionality of the relationship.
</p>
<h4>Example 1</h4>

<p>
  It this example both "customer.contacts" and "details" are OneToMany relationships.
  ```java
  List<Order> orders = Order.find
    .select("status")
    .fetch("customer")
    .fetch("customer.contacts") // contacts is a @OneToMany
    .fetch("details") // details is a @OneToMany
    .orderBy("customer.name")
    .findList();
    ```

    ... results in the "left outer join contact" and related t2.* columns being included in the
    query (so they won't be lazy loaded later).

    ```sql
    -- This first query includes the customer contacts
    -- but does not include the order details
    select t0.id c0, t0.status c1,
    t1.id c2, t1.inactive c3, t1.name c4, ... -- truncated
    t2.id c12, t2.first_name c13, t2.last_name c14, ... -- truncated
    t2.when_updated c19, t2.customer_id c20
    from orders t0
    join customer t1 on t1.id = t0.customer_id
    left outer join contact t2 on t2.customer_id = t1.id
    order by t1.name;
    ```
</p>


<h4>The 'Query Join' query ...</h4>
```sql
-- This second query fetchs the order details associated
-- with the orders that were returned by the first query
select t0.order_id c0, t0.id c1, t0.order_qty c2, ...
from order_detail t0
where (t0.order_id) in (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
order by t0.order_id, t0.id;
--bind(2,1,1,1,3,3,3,4,4,4)
```

<h4>Example 2</h4>

<p>
  In this example contacts is a @OneToMany and then off from each contact notes is a @OneToMany.
</p>
```java
List<Customer> customers = Customer.find
  .fetch("contacts") // contacts is a OneToMany
  .fetch("contacts.notes") // notes is a OneToMany
  .orderBy("name")
  .findList();
  ```

  ```sql
  select t0.id c0, t0.inactive c1, t0.name c2, ...
  t0.when_updated c7, t0.billing_address_id c8, ...
  t1.id c10, t1.first_name c11, t1.last_name c12, ...
  from customer t0
  left outer join be_contact t1 on t1.customer_id = t0.id
  order by t0.name, t0.id
  ```

  <h4>The 'Query Join' query ...</h4>
  ```sql
  -- fetch the contact notes for all the contacts
  select t0.contact_id c0, t0.id c1, t0.contact_id c2, t0.title c3, ...
  from contact_note t0
  where (t0.contact_id) in (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
```

<h2 id="fetchconfig">FetchConfig</h2>

<p>When you specify a Query with Ebean it can result in more than 1 SQL query. Sometimes
you want explicit control over this (what the secondary queries are, batch size used, eager
or lazily invoked)</p>

<p>FetchConfig gives you the ability to specify these "secondary queries" and let them
executed lazily ("lazy loading join") or eagerly ("query join").</p>


<p>Note that explicitly using FetchConfig is not a requirement. Ebean is able to automatically
convert some joins
to "query joins" when it is needed such as when building object graphs with multiple *ToMany
relationships or when limit offset
is used with a *ToMany relationship.</p>


<p>You use FetchConfig to define that you want to use a separate SQL query to fetch that part of
the object graph (to use a "query join" rather than a "fetch join"). What this means is that
Ebean will use 2 SQL queries rather than 1 to build the object graph.
</p>

<p>Note that you do not need to expicitly use FetchConfig if you don't want to. In that case Ebean
will automatically convert any fetch paths over to use FetchConfig if it needs to (multiple
*ToMany relationships etc).
</p>

<p>FetchConfig defines the configuration options for a "query fetch" or a "lazy loading fetch".
This gives you the ability to use multiple smaller queries to populate an object graph as
opposed to a single large query. The primary goal is to provide efficient ways of loading
complex object graphs avoiding SQL Cartesian product and issues around populating object graphs
that have multiple *ToMany relationships. It also provides the ability to control the lazy
loading queries (batch size, selected properties and fetches) to avoid N+1 queries etc.
</p>

<p>
There can also be cases loading across a single OneToMany where 2 SQL queries using Ebean
FetchConfig.query() can be more efficient than one SQL query. When the "One" side is wide (lots
of columns) and the cardinality difference is high (a lot of "Many" beans per "One" bean) then
this can be more efficient loaded as 2 SQL queries.
</p>

<p>The reason for using "Query Joins" as opposed to "Fetch joins" is that there are some
cases where using multiple queries is more efficient that a single query.

<p>

<p>Any time you want to load multiple OneToMany associations it will likely be more
performant as multiple SQL queries. If a single SQL query was used that would result in a
Cartesian product.</p>

<p>There can also be cases loading across a single OneToMany where 2 SQL queries (using
Ebean "query join") can be more efficient than one SQL query (using Ebean "fetch join").
When the "One" side is wide (lots of columns) and the cardinality difference is high (a lot
of "Many" beans per "One" bean) then this can be more efficient loaded as 2 SQL queries.</p>


<p>
Example: Find Orders join details using a single SQL query
```java
// Normal fetch join results in a single SQL query
List<Order> list = Ebean.find(Order.class).fetch("details").findList();
```
<p>

<p>
Example: Using a "query join" instead of a "fetch join" we instead use 2 SQL queries

```java
// This will use 2 SQL queries to build this object graph.
List<Order> list =
  Ebean.find(Order.class)
  .fetch("details", new FetchConfig().query())
  .findList();
  ```
  queries:
  <ol>
    <li>find order</li>
    <li>find orderDetails where order.id in (?,?...) // first 100 order id's</li>
  </ol>
</p>


<p>
Example: Using 2 "query joins"

```java
// This will use 3 SQL queries to build this object graph
List<Order> list =
  Ebean.find(Order.class)
  .fetch("details", new FetchConfig().query())
  .fetch("customer", new FetchConfig().queryFirst(5))
  .findList();
  ```
  queries:
  <ol>
    <li>find order</li>
    <li>find orderDetails where order.id in (?,?...) // first 100 order id's</li>
    <li>find customer where id in (?,?,?,?,?) // first 5 customers</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
Example: Using "query joins" and partial objects

```java
// This will use 3 SQL queries to build this object graph
List<Order> list =
  Ebean.find(Order.class)
  .select("status, shipDate")
  .fetch("details", "quantity, price", new FetchConfig().query())
  .fetch("details.product", "sku, name")
  .fetch("customer", "name", new FetchConfig().queryFirst(5))
  .fetch("customer.contacts")
  .fetch("customer.shippingAddress")
  .findList();
  ```
  queries:
  <ol>
    <li>find order (status, shipDate)</li>
    <li>find orderDetail (quantity, price) fetch product (sku, name) where order.id in (?,?
      ...)
    </li>
    <li>find customer (name) fetch contacts (*) fetch shippingAddress (*) where id in
      (?,?,?,?,?)
    </li>
  </ol>
  Note: the fetch of "details.product" is automatically included into the fetch of "details"<br>
  Note: the fetch of "customer.contacts" and "customer.shippingAddress" are automatically
  included in the fetch of "customer"
</p>

<p>You can use query() and lazy together on a single join. The query is executed immediately
and the lazy defines the batch size to use for further lazy loading (if lazy loading is
invoked).

```java
List<Order> list =
  Ebean.find(Order.class)
  .fetch("customer", new FetchConfig().query(10).lazy(5))
  .findList();
  ```
  queries:
  <ol>
    <li>find order</li>
    <li>find customer where id in (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?) // first 10 customers</li>
    <li>then if lazy loading of customers is invoked, use a batch size of 5 to load the
      customers
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

  <p>
    Example of controlling the lazy loading query:
  </p>

  <p>
    This gives us the ability to optimise the lazy loading query for a given use case.

  ```java:
  List<Order> list = Ebean.find(Order.class)
    .fetch("customer","name", new FetchConfig().lazy(5))
    .fetch("customer.contacts","contactName, phone, email")
    .fetch("customer.shippingAddress")
    .where().eq("status",Order.Status.NEW)
    .findList();
    ```
      queries:
      <ol>
        <li>find order where status = Order.Status.NEW</li>
        <li>if lazy loading of customers is invoked, use a batch size of 5 to load the
          customers.
  </p>
  </ol>

  Note: when the laxy loading of customers is performed, it perform like:
  ```xml
  find customer (name)
  fetch customer.contacts (contactName, phone, email)
  fetch customer.shippingAddress (*)
  where id in (?,?,?,?,?)
  ```


  <p>Example of wo "Query Joins" results in 3 SQL queries used to build an object graph
    ```java
    // A more advanced example with multiple query joins
    List<Order> l0 = Ebean.find(Order.class)
      .select("status, shipDate")
      .fetch("details", "orderQty, unitPrice", new FetchConfig().query())
      .fetch("details.product", "sku, name")
      .fetch("customer", "name", new FetchConfig().query(10))
      .fetch("customer.contacts","firstName, lastName, mobile")
      .fetch("customer.shippingAddress","line1, city")
      .findList();
      ```

      The resulting 3 sql queries are:
  </p>
  <p>
    Query 1 - the main query - Note: customer_id was automatically added to support query join.
    ```xml
    // query 1 … the main query
    <sql summary='Order'>
      select o.id c0, o.status c1, o.ship_date c2, o.customer_id c3
      from orders o
    </sql>
    ```
  </p>
  <p>
    Query 2 - query join on customer - fetching the first 10 customers referenced (batch:10) but
    there where actually only 2 to fetch (actual:2).
    ```xml
    <sql mode='+query' summary='Customer, shippingAddress
+many:contacts' load='path:customer batch:10 actual:2'>
      select c.id c0, c.name c1
      , cs.id c2, cs.line_1 c3, cs.city c4
      , cc.id c5, cc.first_name c6, cc.last_name c7, cc.mobile c8
      from customer c
      left outer join address cs on cs.id = c.shipping_address_id
      left outer join contact cc on cc.customer_id = c.id
      where c.id in (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
      order by c.id
    </sql>
    ```
  </p>
  <p>
    Query 3 – query join on details - fetching the order details for the first 100 orders
    (batch:100).
    ```xml
    <sql mode='+query' summary='Order +many:details, details.product'
         load='path:details batch:100 actual:3'>
      select o.id c0
      , od.id c1, od.order_qty c2, od.unit_price c3
      , odp.id c4, odp.sku c5, odp.name c6
      from orders o
      left outer join order_detail od on od.order_id = o.id
      left outer join product odp on odp.id = od.product_id
      where o.id in (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)
      order by o.id
    </sql>
    ```

  <h4>FetchConfig.lazy() - "Lazy Joins"</h4>

  <p>If a join is not defined at all (neither a fetch join or a query join) – then lazy loading
    will by
    default just fetch all the properties for that entity.
  </p>

  <p>
    FetchConfig.lazy() allows you to control that lazy loading query – define the batch size,
    properties to select and also fetch paths to include on the lazy load query.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is very similar to a "query join" except that the loading occurs on demand (when the
    property is requested and not already loaded).
  </p>

  <p>
    The reason you would want to control the lazy loading query is to optimise performance
    for further lazy loading (avoid N+1 queries, define joins that should be included for lazy
    loading queries, load only the properties required and no more).
  </p>

  <p>
    Example: Control the query used to lazy load
  </p>
  ```java
  // control the lazy loading of customers ...
  List<Order> list = Ebean.find(Order.class)
    .fetch("customer","name", new FetchConfig().lazy(5))
    .fetch("customer.contacts","contactName, phone, email")
    .fetch("customer.shippingAddress")
    .where().eq("status",Order.Status.NEW)
    .findList();
  ```
  <p>
    In the example above the orders are loaded. Only when the application requests a
    customer property (that is not the customer's id) then the lazy loading of the customer is
    invoked. At that point the customer name is loaded, with the contacts and
    shippingAddress – this is done in batch of 5 customers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that if the customer status is requested (rather than the customer name) and that
    invokes the lazy loading then all the customer's properties are loaded (rather than just the
    customers name).

    ```java
    Order order = list.get(0);
    Customer customer = order.getCustomer();

    // this invokes the lazy loading of 5 customers
    String name = customer.getName();
    ```
  </p>

  <p>
    The resulting lazy loading query is …
    ```xml
    <sql mode='+lazy' summary='Customer, shippingAddress +many:contacts'
         load='path:customer batch:5 actual:2'>
      select c.id c0, c.name c1, cs.id c2, cs.line_1 c3, cs.line_2 c4, cs.city c5,
      cs.cretime c6, cs.updtime c7, cs.country_code c8,
      cc.id c9, cc.phone c10, cc.email c11
      from customer c
      left outer join address cs on cs.id = c.shipping_address_id
      left outer join contact cc on cc.customer_id = c.id
      where c.id in (?,?,?,?,?)
      order by c.id
    </sql>
    ```

  <h4>Using both</h4>

  <p>You can use both queryFirst() and lazy() on a single join. The queryFirst() part defines
    the
    number of beans that will be loaded eagerly via an additional query and then lazy defines
    the batch size of the lazy loading that occurs after than (if there is any).

    ```java
    new FetchQuery.queryFirst(100).lazy(10);
    ```

  </p>

  <h4>+query and +lazy – query language syntax</h4>

  <p>
    To define "query joins" and "lazy joins" in the query language you can use +query and
    +lazy. Optionally you can specify the batch size for both.

    ```groovy
    find order
    join customers (+query )
    where status = :status
    ```

    ```groovy
    find order (status, shipDate)
    join customers (+lazy(10) name, status)
    where status = :orderStatus
    ```
  </p>


<#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h2 id="lazy_loading">Lazy loading</h2>
  <h4>
    Fine grained control over lazy loading.
  </h4>

  <p>
    A Partial Object will lazy load the rest of the data on demand when you get or set a
    property it does not have.
  </p>

  ```java
  // find order 12
  // ... fetching the order id, orderDate and version property
  // .... nb: the Id and version property are always fetched

  Order order = Ebean.find(Order.class)
  .select("orderDate")
  .where().idEq(12)
  .findOne();

  // shipDate is not in the partially populated order
  // ... so it will lazy load all the missing properties
  Date shipDate = order.getShipDate();

  // similarly if we where to set the shipDate
  // ... that would also trigger a lazy load
  order.setShipDate(new Date());
  ```

  <p>
    Lazy loading occurs automatically when you set or get a property that the partially
    populated bean does not have.
  </p>
