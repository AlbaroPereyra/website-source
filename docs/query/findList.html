<h3>findList</h3>
<p>
  Returns a list of beans for the query.
</p>
```java
List<Customer> customers =

  where()
    .email.istartsWith("rob")
    .findList();

```
<p>
  Note that we hold all the beans in memory when executing this query.  As such it is good when we
  expect to fetch hundreds of beans but we should consider using a <a href="findEach">findEach</a>
  query when we look to query and read a very large number of results.
