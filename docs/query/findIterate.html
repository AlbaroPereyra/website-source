<h3>findIterate</h3>

<p>
  Execute the query iterating over the results. This is good for processing large results where
  we want to avoid holding all the beans/results in memory but instead iterator through them.
</p>

<h4>close</h4>
<p>
  Note that we must ensure the iterator is <code>closed</code> as it holds JDBC resources.
</p>
<p>
  We should use <code>try with resources</code> or a <code>try finally</code> block to make sure
  that the QueryIterator is closed regardless of exceptions thrown during processing.
</p>
<p>
  Note that <a href="findEach">findEach</a> and <a href="findEachWhile">findEachWhile</a> ensure
  all resoucres are closed regardless and for this reason they are recommended over <code>findIterate</code>.
</p>
<p>
  There are some use cases where findEach and findEachWhile don't naturally fit and that is when we
  would look to use findIterate.
