<h2>Delete query</h2>
<p>
  Execute a query deleting rows.
</p>
```java
int rows = new QContact()
  .name.equalTo("rob@foo.com")
  .delete();
```
```sql
delete from contact where email = ?
```
<h5>Example 2</h5>
```java
    int rows = new QContact()
      .email.startsWith("rob")
      .firstName.eq("Rob")
      .delete();
```
```sql
delete from contact where email like ? escape'|'  and first_name = ?
```

<h5>Example 3</h5>
<p>
  When a where expression is on a associated bean path like <em>OneToMany</em> then the sql delete
  uses a subquery.
</p>
```java
int rows = new QCustomer()
  .contacts.email.contains("foo.com")
  .delete();
```
```sql
delete from customer where id in (
  select distinct t0.id
  from customer t0
  join contact u1 on u1.customer_id = t0.id
  where u1.email like ? escape'|'
)
```

<h4>Cascading delete</h4>
<p>
  If the bean type that we are deleting has cascading delete defined by for example
  <code>@ManyToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL)</code> then the cascade will be honored.
</p>
<h5>Example</h5>
<p>
  In the following example Customer cascades save and delete to billingAddress.
</p>
```java

// setup - a customer with a billing address
Customer customer = new Customer("Bad Example");
customer.setBillingAddress(new Address("My Street", "Hopeful City"));
customer.save();


// deleting customer needs to cascade delete the billingAddress
int rows = new QCustomer()
.name.startsWith("Bad")
.delete();
```
<p>
  The above ends up executing 4 statements in a transaction.
</p>
```sql
-- first select the ids of customers that will be deleted
select t0.id from customer t0 where t0.name like ? escape'' ; --bind(Bad%)

-- select the foreign keys that will be cascade deleted
select t0.id, t0.billing_address_id, t0.shipping_address_id from customer t0 where t0.id in (? )

-- delete the customers
delete from customer where id=?;

-- [cascade] delete the related billing addresses
delete from address where id=?;
```
